# MQTT

In this guide, you will enable MQTT for your product. You will then activate your device and connect your activated device with the Murano MQTT endpoint.

# Requirements

## Hardware Setup

No hardware is required to complete this guide.

## Software Setup

To complete this guide, you must first download and install the following:

  * Python 3.5 from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/).
  * Install a patched version of the Eclipse Paho™ MQTT Python Client via the following command:

  ```
  pip install git+https://github.com/exosite/paho.mqtt.python.git@openssl_sni_support
  ```


# Overview

Exosite’s MQTT offering supports bi-directional device communication with the Murano Platform using the MQTT protocol. Devices can activate with the Murano Platform, can publish device data to its resources in Murano, and can subscribe to changes made to these resources.

Communication between the device and the Murano MQTT endpoint is secured by SSL and made available on port 8883. Note that Exosite uses [SNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication). MQTT client libraries are required to support SNI.

Anonymous access is provided only to facilitate device activation. The activation process supplies the device with the credentials necessary to authenticate in future sessions. Access control, by default, limits activated devices to publish/subscribe only to the device’s own resources. Anonymous clients, in contrast, can only publish to an activation endpoint and can only subscribe to that endpoint’s activation reply topic, which is unique to each activation request.

For information about the MQTT protocol, see [http://mqtt.org/](http://mqtt.org/).

# Getting Started

MQTT [client libraries](https://github.com/mqtt/mqtt.github.io/wiki/libraries) are readily available. Exosite requires that the library supports TLS and requires that the TLS support includes SNI. Contact Exosite if a preferred library fails either criteria. A patched version of [Eclipse Paho™ MQTT Python Client](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.python) is used in the examples below.

## Enable MQTT for Your Product

You need to have an MQTT enabled product; until you can do it on the UI you can use the following commands:


For those to work seamlessly you have to have jq 1.5 installed and
BIZEMAL and BIZPASS environment variables have to be set to your exosite-dev credentials;

```bash
BIZEMAIL=myemail@exosite.com
BIZPASS=mypassword
BIZNAME=mytestbiz1
PROJNAME=testproj
```

```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -sX POST 'https://bizapi-dev.hosted.exosite.io/api:1/token/' \
-d '{"email":"'${BIZEMAIL}'","password":"'${BIZPASS}'","ttl":86400}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' | jq -e -r .token)

BIZID=$(curl -s -X POST 'https://bizapi-dev.hosted.exosite.io/api:1/business/' -d '{"name":"'${BIZNAME}'"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H "Authorization: token ${TOKEN}" | jq -e -r .id )

PROJID=$(curl -s -X POST "https://bizapi-dev.hosted.exosite.io/api:1/business/${BIZID}/solution/" -d '{"label":"'${PROJNAME}'", "type":"product"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H "Authorization: token ${TOKEN}" | jq -e -r .id)

PAYLOAD='{"resources":{"temp":{"format":"number","settable":true, "allowed":[]}}}'

curl -i -X PATCH "https://bizapi-dev.hosted.exosite.io/api:1/service/${PROJID}/device2" -H "Authorization: token ${TOKEN}" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "$PAYLOAD"
(expect 204)

PAYLOAD='{"protocol":{"name":"mqtt"}}'

curl -i -X PATCH "https://bizapi-dev.hosted.exosite.io/api:1/service/${PROJID}/device2" -H "Authorization: token ${TOKEN}" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "$PAYLOAD"
(expect 204)
```

This creates a new product patches it to have MQTT protocol type and adds
a new number resource called: temp.

You can print the product ID with
`echo $PROJID`

You will need this product ID when activating the device

## Provision Your Device

The product above is created with presenter_identity=true. This means that when you try to activate an unknown device; it will be automatically added


1. Save the following certificate into a file called "trusted.crt":

  ```
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  MIIDVDCCAjygAwIBAgIDAjRWMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBBQUAMEIxCzAJBgNVBAYTAlVT

  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

NOTE: exosite-dev has a self signed certificate; so examples below
currently ignore certificate validation

2. Save the following code into a file called "activate.py" to the same folder where the trusted.crt is and run it using “python activate.py”:

```python
from paho.mqtt import client as mqtt
import ssl

host = input("Product ID? ") + ".m2.exosite-dev.io"
cert = "./trusted.crt"

def on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc):
    provision_str = "$provision/" + input("Device ID? ")
    client.publish(provision_str, None, qos=0)

def on_message(client, userdata, msg):
    print("Activation succeeded!")
    print("Token: ", msg.payload.decode())
    client.disconnect()

def on_disconnect(client, userdata, rc):
    if rc != 0:
        print("DisConnected with error", rc)
        exit()

client = mqtt.Client(client_id="")
client.tls_set(
    ca_certs=cert,
    server_hostname=host,
    cert_reqs=ssl.CERT_NONE
)
client.tls_insecure_set(True)

client.on_connect = on_connect
client.on_disconnect = on_disconnect
client.on_message = on_message

client.connect(host, 443)
client.loop_forever()
```

**NOTE**: The client connects anonymously and then provisions itself using the device identity as the client ID. It then prints the token that has to be used for read and write.

3. Provide your product ID, Device identity when it is asked for.

```bash
$ python activate.py
Product ID? x2lmj5npsktbuik9
Device ID? 12345

Activation succeeded!
Token: b7b34f55e948b94841820ea50868a2490632d78f
```
A successful result, as shown, activates the device and prints the credentials necessary to subsequently authenticate. You can see on the UI that the device has been "activated". You save the device ID for later usage: `SN=12345`

## Publish to an Activated Device

Next, we'll use the returned credentials to reconnect.

Save the following code into a file called "publish.py" and run it using “python publish.py”:

```python
from paho.mqtt import client as mqtt
import ssl

host = input("Product ID? ") + ".m2.exosite-dev.io"
cert = "./trusted.crt"

def on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc):
    resource = "$resource/" + input("Resource ID? ")
    client.publish(resource, input("Value? "), qos=0)
    client.disconnect()

def on_message(client, userdata, msg):
 print("Value set, previous was: ", msg.payload.decode())

def on_disconnect(client, userdata, rc):
    if rc != 0:
        print("DisConnected with error", rc)
        exit()

client = mqtt.Client(client_id="")
client.tls_set(
    ca_certs=cert,
    server_hostname=host,
    cert_reqs=ssl.CERT_NONE
)
client.tls_insecure_set(True)
client.username_pw_set("", input("Device token? "))

client.on_connect = on_connect
client.on_disconnect = on_disconnect
client.on_message = on_message

client.connect(host, 443)
client.loop_forever()
```
Prompts will be similar to those used to activate. The device’s resources are represented as topics "$resource/<resourceName>" (e.g., $resource/temp”).
You can publish a temperature value as follows:

```bash
$ python publish.py
Product ID? d23kegyeoxb280000
Device token? XzE3KU2Zhs9ZDl0cSz0Lf8Xp5Ez7rR0cUa1rO4qE
Resource ID? temp
Value? 23
```


The device’s resource’s value will reflect the value published by the device:
You can check the value on the Murano UI or reading the state from the command line


## Receiving data from the server

Copy the following code to a file called read.py

```python
from paho.mqtt import client as mqtt
import ssl

host = input("Product ID? ") + ".m2.exosite-dev.io"
cert = "./trusted.crt"

def on_message(client, userdata, msg):
 print("Received: ", msg.payload.decode())

def on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc):
  print("Waiting for messages")

def on_disconnect(client, userdata, rc):
    if rc != 0:
        print("DisConnected with error", rc)
        exit()

client = mqtt.Client(client_id="")
client.tls_set(
    ca_certs=cert,
    server_hostname=host,
    cert_reqs=ssl.CERT_NONE
)
client.tls_insecure_set(True)
client.username_pw_set("", input("Device token? "))

client.on_connect = on_connect
client.on_disconnect = on_disconnect
client.on_message = on_message

client.connect(host, 443)
client.loop_forever()
```

This will receive messages from the server. If you change the state of a resource you
will receive a message with the new value

You can change the state with the following command:

```bash
curl -i -XPATCH \
https://okami-api-dev.hosted.exosite.io/api/v1/$PROJID/identity/$SN/state \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"temp":58}'
```

Additionally, you can change the state on the Murano UI as well
